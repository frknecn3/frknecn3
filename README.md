<h1> Hi There!</h1>

My name is Furkan.

I'm currently a Front-end Developer aiming to become a Full-stack Developer in the future.

I'm interested in many sides of programming, such as video game programming, web development etc.

I'm currently learning React and Javascript. Casually learning C# as well.

I can collaborate on everything and love teamwork.

My style of thinking is that "Nobody ever walked without stumbling, nobody ever ran without falling." So, whenever I come across a problem, I don't give up and solve it no matter how hard it is.
