<h1> Hi There!</h1>

My name is Furkan.

I'm looking forward to be a front-end developer in the first place, I'll aim to become a full-stack developer in the future.

I'm interested in many sides of programming, such as video game programming, web development etc.

I'm currently learning React and Javascript. Casually learning C# as well.

I can collaborate on everything and love teamwork.

You can contact me via WhatsApp, Github, Discord or Steam. And if necessary, by phone.
