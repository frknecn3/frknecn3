<h1> Hi There !  </h1>

My name is Furkan.

I'm currently a Front-end Developer aiming to become a Full-stack Developer in the future.

I'm interested in many sides of programming, such as video game programming, web development etc.

I use HTML, CSS, JS, React.js and TypeScript in my projects. As of now I am casually learning C# as well.

I can collaborate on everything, love teamwork and absolutely adore products that come out of a well-organized team.

My style of thinking is that "Nobody ever walked without stumbling, nobody ever ran without falling." So, whenever I come across a problem, I don't give up and solve it no matter how hard it is.
